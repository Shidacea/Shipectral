# Simple AI routine model.
# The basic principle is that each entity has a master AI routine, which gets called once per frame.
# Parallel to the master AI another secondary AI is running, also once per frame.
# However, both AI processes have different tasks.
# The master AI controls which AI page should be active for the secondary AI.
# The secondary AI should be used for the actual entity routines.
# This way, the secondary AI routine may pause (using SDC::wait), while AI page switching is still possible.
# Switching AI pages furthermore preserves the waiting status and any local variables.
# The main usage is to switch between different AI pages if the entity collides with another entity, for example, even if the current AI page is waiting.
# The AI system itself is designed to avoid infinite loops in scripts as far as possible, while preserving total control.
