* [ ] SPTLib as port of SDCLib
* [ ] Port all Shidacea engine and core methods
* [ ] Port entity-component system of Shidacea
* [ ] Port demo projects
* [ ] Try to implement ImGui

# Differences from Shidacea

# Installation

Note that this current version does only run on Windows 64bit.
You need to provide a folder third_party with the subfolders crystal, crSFML, anyolite and SFML.

crystal needs to contain the crystal source code and a working Windows executable.

crSFML needs to contain the crSFML source code.

SFML needs to contain a recent Visual Studio 64bit SFML release with folders bin, lib and include in it.

anyolite needs to contain the full anyolite shard including submodules.

Then run cmake using Visual Studio.
